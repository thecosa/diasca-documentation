# Executive Summary

## Introduction

The Digital Integration of Agricultural Supply Chains Alliance (DIASCA) is an initiative aimed at addressing the fragmented landscape of digital solutions in the agricultural value chain. By establishing a Sustainability Data Standard (SDS), DIASCA seeks to create a unified framework for data interoperability, improving efficiency, and enhancing the ability to achieve meaningful sustainability outcomes.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of the DIASCA project are:
1. **Interoperability**: Develop and promote a common data standard to facilitate seamless data exchange across different platforms and systems.
2. **Data Governance**: Establish robust governance structures for data management, ensuring data quality, security, and privacy.
3. **Efficiency**: Reduce the reporting burden and resource wastage associated with duplicated data collection efforts.
4. **Shared Learning**: Enhance opportunities for shared learning and collective impact by enabling better data sharing and analysis.

## Key Components

### 1. Data Model
The DIASCA data model, defined in DBML format, encompasses various entities in the agro supply chain, including enterprises, sites, plots, people, products, batches, transactions, and events. This structured approach ensures comprehensive data coverage and interoperability.

### 2. Parameter Standardization
Parameter standardization ensures that key data elements are consistently defined and used across the entire supply chain. This includes standardizing types of enterprises, sites, plot parameters, and transaction attributes.

### 3. Data Transmission Standards
Data transmission standards outline the protocols and formats for exchanging data between systems. By adhering to standards such as HTTPS, SFTP, and data formats like JSON, DIASCA ensures secure and efficient data exchange.

### 4. Data Mapping and Integration
Data mapping and integration processes facilitate the seamless flow of data from diverse sources into the DIASCA system. This includes defining source-to-target mappings, establishing ETL processes, and utilizing API integrations for real-time data exchange.

### 5. Data Validation Framework
A robust data validation framework is essential for maintaining data integrity. This framework includes schema validation, value constraints, and the use of automated scripts and manual review techniques to ensure data accuracy and consistency.

## Expected Impact

The implementation of the DIASCA Sustainability Data Standard is expected to have significant positive impacts, including:
- **Enhanced Efficiency**: Streamlined data collection and reporting processes.
- **Improved Data Quality**: Higher data accuracy and consistency across systems.
- **Cost Savings**: Reduced duplication of efforts and resource wastage.
- **Greater Insights**: Improved ability to analyze and act on data for sustainability outcomes.
- **Collaborative Advantage**: Fostered collaboration among stakeholders through shared data and learning.

## Conclusion

DIASCA represents a pioneering effort to harmonize data management in the agricultural sector. By establishing a common data standard and promoting interoperability, DIASCA aims to transform the way data is collected, shared, and utilized, ultimately driving better sustainability practices and outcomes across the agro supply chain.
