# Project Background

## Introduction

The agricultural sector is vital for global food security and economic development. However, it faces numerous challenges, including inefficiencies in data management and a lack of interoperability among digital solutions. The proliferation of disparate, stand-alone systems for farm management, supply chain logistics, traceability, market access, and other functions has resulted in data silos, duplicated efforts, and suboptimal outcomes.

## Context

The Digital Integration of Agricultural Supply Chains Alliance (DIASCA) was formed to address these challenges by promoting a unified approach to data management. DIASCA comprises COSA and other key technology, industry, and standards organizations working collaboratively to create and implement a Sustainability Data Standard (SDS). This initiative aims to standardize data collection, storage, and exchange across the agricultural supply chain, ensuring consistency and interoperability.

### Challenges in the Current Landscape

1. **Fragmentation**: Multiple, unconnected digital solutions lead to fragmented data and inefficiencies.
2. **Data Silos**: Proprietary data architectures prevent seamless data exchange, resulting in isolated data sets.
3. **Resource Wastage**: Duplication of data collection efforts squanders resources and increases the reporting burden.
4. **Missed Opportunities**: Lack of shared learning and collaborative data analysis hinders progress toward sustainability goals.

## Key Objectives

DIASCA aims to overcome these challenges by establishing a common data standard that enables the consistent collection, interoperability, and use of data across different systems. The key objectives of the DIASCA project are:

1. **Interoperability**: Create a common format for data transmission that allows different platforms and entities to exchange data seamlessly.
2. **Data Governance**: Implement robust data governance frameworks to ensure data quality, security, and privacy.
3. **Efficiency**: Reduce redundant data collection efforts and streamline reporting processes.
4. **Shared Learning**: Enhance collaborative learning and collective impact through improved data sharing and analysis.

## Strategic Approach

### Development of the Sustainability Data Standard (SDS)

The SDS will include:

- **Key Data Elements (KDE)**: Standardized data elements that ensure consistency across systems.
- **Taxonomies and Ontologies**: Structured vocabularies that enable clear and unambiguous data representation.
- **Critical Tracking Events (CTE)**: Defined events that are essential for traceability and monitoring within the supply chain.
- **Data Governance Policies**: Guidelines and policies to manage data quality, security, and privacy.

### Pilot Projects

DIASCA will implement pilot projects to test and refine the SDS. These projects will involve key stakeholders across the agricultural supply chain, providing real-world scenarios to validate the standard’s effectiveness.

### Collaboration and Engagement

Collaboration is central to DIASCA’s strategy. The project involves:

- **Multi-Stakeholder Engagement**: Engaging a diverse group of stakeholders, including farmers, supply chain actors, technology providers, and standards organizations.
- **Capacity Building**: Providing training and support to stakeholders to facilitate the adoption of the SDS.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly reviewing and updating the SDS based on feedback and new developments in technology and data management.

## Expected Outcomes

By implementing the Sustainability Data Standard, DIASCA aims to achieve:

- **Improved Data Quality**: Enhanced accuracy and consistency of data across the supply chain.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Streamlined processes and reduced resource wastage.
- **Better Decision-Making**: Data-driven insights that support sustainable practices and policies.
- **Increased Collaboration**: Stronger partnerships and shared learning among stakeholders.

## Conclusion

The DIASCA project represents a significant step toward transforming data management in the agricultural sector. By addressing the challenges of fragmentation, data silos, and inefficiencies, DIASCA aims to create a more integrated, efficient, and sustainable agricultural supply chain. The Sustainability Data Standard is the cornerstone of this transformation, providing a robust framework for data interoperability and shared learning.
