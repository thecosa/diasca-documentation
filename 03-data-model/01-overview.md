# Overview

The DIASCA Sustainability Data Standard (SDS) aims to provide a comprehensive and unified framework for data interoperability across the agricultural supply chain. At the core of the SDS is the Data Model, which defines the structure and relationships of various entities involved in the agro supply chain.

This section provides an overview of the data model, its components, and its significance within the SDS.

## Components of the Data Model

1. **Enterprises**: Represents organizations involved in the agro supply chain.
2. **Sites**: Represents physical locations owned or operated by enterprises.
3. **Plots**: Specific areas within a site, typically used for cultivation.
4. **People**: Individuals involved in the agro supply chain.
5. **Products**: Agricultural products.
6. **Batches**: Specific quantities of products.
7. **Transactions**: Exchanges of products between enterprises.
8. **Events**: Significant occurrences in the supply chain.

## Importance of the Data Model

The data model ensures that all entities and their interactions are consistently represented across different systems, facilitating seamless data exchange and integration. By standardizing the way data is structured and shared, the SDS helps reduce inefficiencies, improve data quality, and promote collaboration and shared learning.
