# Data Mapping and Integration Guide

This guide provides instructions on how to align existing data systems with the DIASCA standard, ensuring smooth integration and data exchange across different platforms in the agricultural supply chain.

## Mapping Existing Data Structures

To align your current system with the DIASCA model, follow these steps:

1. Identify corresponding entities in your current system to the DIASCA model (e.g., your "Farm" might map to our "Site").
2. Create a mapping table that shows how each of your fields corresponds to DIASCA fields.
3. For fields that don't have a direct correspondence, consider using the parameter tables.

### Example Mapping Table

| Your System | DIASCA Model |
|-------------|--------------|
| Farm        | Site         |
| Farm.Name   | Site.name    |
| Farm.Location | Site.latitude, Site.longitude |
| Farm.Size   | Site.size    |
| Farm.Type   | Site.type    |

## Handling Custom Fields

For fields in your system that don't have a direct match in the DIASCA model:

1. Use the appropriate parameter table (e.g., SiteParameters for Site-related custom fields).
2. Choose a descriptive key name for your custom field.
3. Store the value in the 'value' field of the parameter table.

### Example

Let's say you have a custom field for soil pH in your Farm entity:

```sql
INSERT INTO SiteParameters (site_id, key, value, observation_date)
VALUES (1, 'soil_ph', '6.5', '2023-07-10');
```

This approach allows you to maintain your custom data while adhering to the DIASCA standard.

## Automated Mapping Tools

To facilitate the data mapping and integration process, you can leverage various automated mapping tools. These tools can significantly reduce the time and effort required for data integration, especially for large and complex datasets.

### Talend

Talend is an open-source data integration platform that provides a graphical interface for designing and implementing data mappings.

**Key features:**
- Visual mapping interface
- Support for various data sources and formats
- Built-in data quality and cleansing tools

**Usage example:**
1. Create a new job in Talend Open Studio.
2. Use tFileInputDelimited to read your source data.
3. Use tMap to define mappings between your fields and DIASCA fields.
4. Use tFileOutputJSON to output the mapped data in DIASCA-compliant JSON format.

### Informatica PowerCenter

Informatica PowerCenter is a comprehensive data integration platform suitable for enterprise-level implementations.

**Key features:**
- Advanced mapping capabilities
- Robust data transformation tools
- Scalability for large datasets

**Usage example:**
1. Create a new mapping in PowerCenter Designer.
2. Define your source and target (DIASCA model) schemas.
3. Use the Expression Editor to handle complex field mappings.
4. Create a workflow to schedule and automate the mapping process.

### Apache NiFi

Apache NiFi is a data integration tool that focuses on automating data flows between systems.

**Key features:**
- Web-based user interface
- Real-time data streaming capabilities
- Extensible through custom processors

**Usage example:**
1. Create a new flow in the NiFi canvas.
2. Use GetFile or GetHTTP processors to ingest your source data.
3. Use JoltTransformJSON to map your data to the DIASCA model.
4. Use PutFile or InvokeHTTP to output the mapped data to your desired destination.

When choosing an automated mapping tool, consider factors such as:
- The scale of your data integration needs
- Your team's technical expertise
- Integration with your existing technology stack
- Cost and licensing models

Remember that while these tools can greatly facilitate the mapping process, a thorough understanding of both your data model and the DIASCA model is crucial for accurate and efficient data integration.
