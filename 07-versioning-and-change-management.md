# Versioning and Change Management

Effective versioning and change management are crucial for maintaining the integrity and consistency of data systems. This guide outlines the best practices and procedures for managing changes to the DIASCA data model and associated documentation.

## Versioning Guidelines

### Semantic Versioning

DIASCA follows semantic versioning to clearly communicate changes and updates. Semantic versioning uses a three-part version number: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

- **MAJOR** version increases when there are incompatible API changes.
- **MINOR** version increases when functionality is added in a backward-compatible manner.
- **PATCH** version increases when backward-compatible bug fixes are made.

### Version Numbering

Each version number consists of three components:

- **MAJOR**: Incremented for incompatible changes.
- **MINOR**: Incremented for backward-compatible additions or improvements.
- **PATCH**: Incremented for backward-compatible bug fixes.

Example: `1.2.3`
- `1` is the MAJOR version.
- `2` is the MINOR version.
- `3` is the PATCH version.

## Change Management Process

### Proposing Changes

1. **Identify the Need for Change**: Determine if the change is necessary for fixing a bug, adding a new feature, or improving existing functionality.
2. **Create a Change Proposal**: Document the proposed change, including the rationale, scope, and potential impact.
3. **Submit the Proposal**: Submit the change proposal to the relevant stakeholders or through the established project management system.

### Review and Approval

1. **Review Process**: The proposed change is reviewed by a designated review committee or team. This review includes assessing the impact, feasibility, and alignment with project goals.
2. **Feedback and Revisions**: Provide feedback on the proposal and request revisions if necessary.
3. **Approval**: Once the proposal is reviewed and revised, it is approved for implementation.

### Implementation

1. **Plan the Implementation**: Develop a detailed implementation plan, including timelines, resources, and responsibilities.
2. **Execute the Plan**: Implement the change according to the plan, ensuring that all dependencies and integrations are managed.
3. **Testing and Validation**: Thoroughly test the changes to ensure they work as expected and do not introduce new issues.

### Communication

1. **Notify Stakeholders**: Communicate the changes to all relevant stakeholders, including details of the change, its impact, and any actions required.
2. **Update Documentation**: Ensure that all relevant documentation is updated to reflect the changes.
3. **Release Notes**: Publish release notes summarizing the changes, improvements, and bug fixes included in the new version.

## Documentation

Maintaining up-to-date documentation is essential for effective change management. All changes should be documented in detail, including:

1. **Change Logs**: A record of all changes made, including version numbers, dates, and descriptions of the changes.
2. **API Documentation**: Updated to reflect any changes to API endpoints, parameters, or responses.
3. **User Guides**: Revised to help users understand and utilize new features or changes.

## Tools and Practices

1. **Version Control Systems**: Use version control systems (e.g., Git) to manage changes to the codebase and documentation. This allows for tracking changes, collaborative editing, and rollback if necessary.
2. **Automated Testing**: Implement automated testing to quickly identify issues introduced by changes and ensure that existing functionality is not broken.
3. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Use CI/CD pipelines to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying changes, ensuring faster and more reliable releases.
4. **Change Management Tools**: Utilize tools such as JIRA or Trello to manage change proposals, track progress, and collaborate with team members.

By following these versioning and change management guidelines, the DIASCA project can ensure a structured and transparent approach to managing changes, maintaining high standards of quality and consistency across the system.
